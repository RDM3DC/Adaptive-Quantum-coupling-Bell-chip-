## Hardware Pathways
We added a practical appendix for **implementing \(g_x,g_y\)** and running P1â€“P3 on **superconducting qubits**, **trapped ions**, and **integrated photonics**. It covers realâ€‘time memory loops (FPGA/analog), measurement protocols, units, CSV formats, and common pitfalls.

ðŸ‘‰ See **`HARDWARE_PATHWAYS.md`** for the full playbook.
